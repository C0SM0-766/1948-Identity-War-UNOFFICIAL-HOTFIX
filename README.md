To say the last three years have been chaotic would be an understatement. With the world in an abyss of uncertainty over whether to remain somewhat united or splinter off into factions, the United States finds itself at a crossroads, one that will shake the world to its core. The New Deal Coalition is now torn asunder, and all that's left is an all-out war between President Wallace and Governor Thurmond for the fate of what was once the party of those such as Jackson, Bryan, and Wilson.

The Republicans, who are not exempt from this factionalism, find themselves trying to mend fences in an attempt to capture the White House after four devastating defeats during a rising tide of conservatism and isolationism, not unlike three decades before. After a rough primary, Robert Taft looks to bring traditional Republican values right back into the limelight.

• Henry Wallace must continue to advocate for his diplomatic foreign relations with the Soviets, while emphasizing the strength of his domestic credentials if he wants to mount any form of a comeback. With the party on the brink of disaster, it's all up to him to keep it alive.

• To avoid further splintering an already fractious party, Robert Taft must persuade the public that isolationism is best while balancing domestic policy in an era ruled by the New Deal. If successful, he could very well shift the window back to the right.

• Strom Thurmond's goal is to hold onto the South if he wishes to establish his new, fragile party. Yet there's also the opportunity to deadlock this race at great risk by undercutting the Republicans.
